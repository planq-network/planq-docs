# IBC (Planq Chain, other Cosmos chains)

## Introduction

![centered image](../assets/webappintro.png)

The Planq Bridgeâ€™s goal is to support the seamless transfer of assets between blockchains to foster interoperability and for users to enjoy the best DApps and earnings no matter the chain.

The Deltaswap Bridge can be found at [https://swap.deltaswap.io](https://swap.deltaswap.io).

Planq Bridge is a fully decentralised protocol built on the open-source projects of [IBC](https://ibcprotocol.org/).

Please read this guide and review the project documentation carefully as misuse may cause the incorrect transfer or even loss of assets. We recommend transferring a small amount first to get yourself acquainted with the Bridge before moving over significant amounts.

#### Currently supported networks:

* BSC <=> Planq;
* Cosmos <=> Planq;
* Osmosis <=> Planq;
* Kujira<=> Planq

#### Currently supported tokens:

* PLQ;
* WBNB;

#### Currently supported wallets:

We are constantly working on adding new tokens and blockchains. If you have any feedback or concerns, please reach out to us at product.bridge@crypto.org.
