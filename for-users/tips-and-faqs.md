# ðŸ’¡ Tips & FAQs

**How can I get started on Planq chain?**

* For most end-users, the easiest way to get started on Planq chain is to start with a Crypto.com app account and then transfer some PLQ and cryptocurrency holdings to your self-custodial wallet on Planq via the "withdraw" feature.
* With respect to the choice of a self-custodial wallet, a Leap Wallet, MetaMask, or Brave wallet is a good place to start. You can start trying other wallets once you become more familiar with self-custody.
* Don't forget that you need PLQ in your wallet in order to pay for transaction fees on Planq chain.

**Where can I find the list of applications available on Planq chain?**

* In the Leap Wallet, you can check the "browser" tab where you can see a selection of apps.
* You can also visit https://planq.network/ecosystem to browser a database of available dapps (decentralized apps).

**I have transferred cryptocurrencies by mistake to an address on Planq chain. Can someone help me to recover the funds?**

* Planq chain is a public, open-source, decentralized, immutable blockchain network. The Planq team coordinates open-source development of the network, but it has no control over the network.
* If you have sent your cryptocurrencies to an incorrect address or network, it is not materially possible for the Planq team to revert the transaction or recover these funds. You need to contact the owner of the address where the funds have been sent.
* If you are the owner of that address and the address is self-custodial, meaning that you know the seed phrase or private key of the address, then you should be able to take control of the funds yourself. For this, you need to use either the [Leap Wallet](https://leapwallet.io) or [MetaMask](https://metamask.io), where you can import either the seed phrase (Leap Wallet) or private key (MetaMask) of the address. You can then connect to Planq chain (see for example [https://docs.planq.network/for-users/metamask](https://docs.planq.network/for-users/metamask)). You may then transfer your funds to another address.
* On the other hand, if you are not the owner of the address, it can be very difficult to contact the owner. If the address is the deposit address of a custodial exchange that does not support Planq, most of the time it is not possible to recover the funds, and in any case, only the owner of that address can help.
