# üèÖ Hacker's getting started resources

## Overview of Planq chain

[Planq](https://planq.network/) is the leading Ethereum-compatible layer 1 blockchain network built on the Cosmos SDK, [Planq](https://planq.network) and more than 500 app developers and partners. Today, the #PLQ ecosystem represents an addressable user base of more than 80 million people worldwide. Our mission is to make it easy and safe for the next billion crypto users to adopt Web3, with a focus on DeFi and GameFi.

## Hack with Planq ü•ö

Developing Dapps on Planq is as easy as developing them on any of the major EVM-compatible chains: write and test solidity with Hardhat, deploy your contract, connect your frontend or your backend with ethers.js, and connect your wallet with MetaMask or Leap Wallet.

The native cryptocurrency of Planq mainnet is PLQ, while the testnet uses TPLQ.

**Planq overview & key links for developers**

* Planq docs: [https://docs.planq.network](https://docs.planq.network)

**MetaMask end-user configuration**

* For more details, see [Metamask configuration](../for-users/metamask.md)

**JSON-RPC endpoint configuration**

*   For most use cases you can use the free endpoints that are provided by Planq. Most developers use a configuration file that looks like this:

    For Hardhat:

    ```json
    {
    "planq_mainnet": {
          "chainId": 25,
          "url": "https://evm-rpc.planq.network/",
          "gasPrice": 5000000000000,
          "blockExplorer": "https://evm.planq.network/",
          "blockExplorerPrefix": "https://evm.planq.network/tx/"
        }    
    }
    ```

    or, using EIP1559 in a Node.js backend:

    ```json
    {
    "planq_mainnet": {
          "id": 25,
          "url": "https://evm-rpc.planq.network/",
          "maxPriorityFeePerGas": 5000000000,
          "maxFeePerGas": 6000000000000,
          "blockExplorer": "https://evm.planq.network/",
          "blockExplorerPrefix": "https://evm.planq.network/tx/"
        }
    }
    ```

## Essential developer tools üíª

Write, test and deploy smart contracts

* Smart contracts library: [OpenZeppelin](https://www.openzeppelin.com/)
* Compile & test: [Hardhat](https://hardhat.org/)

Connect your Dapp to the blockchain

* Web3 library for Javascript / Typescript: [ethers.js](https://docs.ethers.io/v5/), [web3.js](https://web3js.readthedocs.io/)
* Web3 library for Python: [web3.py](https://web3py.readthedocs.io/)
