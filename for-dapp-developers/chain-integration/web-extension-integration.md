# Wallet integrations

Planq chain is supported by the following self-custodial wallets:

* Leap Wallet.
* Keplr Wallet.
* MetaMask (requires custom network configuration).
* and more than 30 other wallets.

Leap Wallet, Keplr Wallet and MetaMask have mobile apps that include in-app dApp browsers. Users can access dApps on the go via these in-app browsers. We recommend that all dApp developers integrate with these 3 wallets at least, and more if possible.

## Leap Wallet

#### &#x20;A non-custodial wallet to store, earn, and grow your crypto

[Leap Wallet](https://leapwallet.io) is a non-custodial wallet that gives users full control of their crypto and private keys. Private keys are encrypted locally on the userâ€™s mobile phone, and protected by Biometric Authentication.&#x20;

If you are a dApp developer, integration with the Leap Wallet is the best way to deliver a smooth user experience all Planq users around the world.

Users will be able to login with your dApp in several ways:

* On Mobile, they can visit your dApp and connect to it via the in-app browser of the Leap Wallet iOS or Android apps.
* On Desktop, they can install the Leap Wallet Extension from the Chrome extension store into their Chrome, Edge or Brave browser. The extension can be connected to the Leap Wallet mobile app (in which case the user will need to confirm each transaction on their mobile phone), or alternatively it can work as a standalone extension entirely in the browser.

To get your dApp listed on the dApp section of Leap Wallet, the steps are as below:&#x20;

* Make sure your dApp completes the integration of our SDK and the wallet connection is working
* Submit your dApp on [Dapp.Space](https://dapp.space)
* DeFi Wallet Team review submission with stakeholders
* DeFi Wallet Team proceed with the dApp listing

### Overview

As a developer, if you would like to offer all the mobile and desktop connection options provided by the Leap Wallet, the first step is to integrate your dApp with the Leap Wallet Wallet  Extension.

Once the Wallet Extension is working, all the other connection methods should start working as well, even on mobile, since they are supported by the same SDKs.

The Leap Wallet Extension currently supports the following networks:
