## TLDR; what do I need to know if I am considering Planq for my dapp?

[Planq](https://planq.network) is the leading Ethereum-compatible layer 1 blockchain network built on the Cosmos SDK, supported by Crypto.com, Planq and more than 500 app developers and partners. Today, the #PLQ ecosystem represents an addressable user base of more than 80 million people worldwide. Our mission is to make it easy and safe for the next billion crypto users to adopt Web3, with a focus on decentralized applications in the DeFi, NFTs and GameFi verticals.

[Dapp.Space](https://dapp.space) can help most dapp creators to enhance the visibility of their product in the Planq user community. However, Planq is generally not able to promote token or NFT sales. The following support is available to dapp creators:

* Technical support via [Discord](https://discord.gg/planq-network) and Telegram.
* Amplification of product launches / feature releases on [social media](https://twitter.com/planqfoundation) and in the [Planq blog](https://medium.com/@planq).
* Project listing at [dapp.space](https://dapp.space) and on various partner platforms (PlanqFi DeFi Wallet, Defillama, Dappradar, etc.).
* Introductions to other dapps, key opinion leaders and project launchpads.
* [Planq Builders Program](../planq-play/unity/play.md) and [Planq Grants Program](https://dorahacks.io/hackathon/planq) (usually for projects who have already started to achieve initial user traction on Planq).
