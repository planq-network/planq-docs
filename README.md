Our mission is to make it easy and safe for the next billion crypto users to adopt Web3, with a focus on decentralized applications in the DeFi, NFTs and GameFi verticals.

Shortly after launch in November 2021, Planq achieved a top 100 position amongst all chains by TVL. It is home to more than 1 million users and 500+ dApps.

Transaction fees are paid in the native token of the Planq Blockchain,[ $PLQ. ](https://www.coingecko.com/nl/coins/planq)
