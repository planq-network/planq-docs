### Adding new page to the docs

1. Create a markdown file `[Newfile.md]` under one of the main categories, e.g. `for-users/`, `for-node-hosts/`, `for-dapp-developers/` or `cronos-play/`
2. Open `SUMMARY.md` and add the new markdown file in the right file structure, e.g.

```md
## FOR USERS

* [MetaMask](for-users/metamask.md)
* [Bridge](for-users/bridge/README.md)
  * [New file](for-users/bridge/Newfile.md)
```

### Style guide

* Use 3 levels at most
* Categorise docs mostly per user, dapp, node hosts
* Keep docs/sentences short, DRY and modular
* Use tabs, tables, hints and relative page links
* Double check SUMMARY.md and prefer the use of horizontal images
